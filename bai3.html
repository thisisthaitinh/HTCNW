     <p><span style="color:brown">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>
     <p>I've started putting up a <a href="slide1.html">slide show</a> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.</p>
     <p>Once again: <i style="color:brown">BRAVO!!!</i> -- Mrs. Juroszek</p>
